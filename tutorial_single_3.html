        <h3>What is to be achieved</h3>

        <div class="tutorialItem">
            We are continuing on from <a href="tutorial_single_2.html">Tutorial 2</a>, in this tutorial we will wrap
            up this tutorial by spending some time discussing the grunt file.  We will add the ability to edit and
            delete ToDo's, do some simple swipe handling, and throw in an About Page.

        <h3>Grunt</h3>

        <div class="tutorialItem">
            When we used Yeoman to create our project, it helpfully created a Gruntfile for us.  What that gruntfile does
            depends on whether or not we have included Phonegap in the project.  If we haven't included phonegap it
            is basically just a skeleton of a gruntfile that provides an HTTP server (which is the default action even if Phonegap is included).
            <br/><br/>
            While this isn't a tutorial on <a href="http://gruntjs.com">Grunt</a>, let's quickly look at what we have included:

            <code class="language-javascript">'http-server': {
    dev : {
        port: 3000,
        root: './app/'
    }
}</code>

            Is the clip of code that creates the HTTP server, feel free to change it's port if 3000 conflicts with another
            application.<br/><br/>

            There are two more grunt commands that are created for you that you should know about how they work: 'debug', 'debug-cordova'.<br/><br/>

            <dl>
                <dt>debug-cordova</dt><dd>This places a debug version (non-minimized) of all of the files into the ./cordova/www directory.  Once
            this is done, you can run <code class="noblock">$ cordova prepare</code> in the cordova directory to build application. </dd>
                <dt>cordova</dt><dd>This places a production version (minimized css, and javascript) into the ./cordova/www directory.</dd>
            </dl>

            There are a few of things to note about these commands:

            <ol>
                <li>The dist directory is used as a scratchpad directory when building the production output, check there to see if anything went wrong</li>
                <li>Javascript files are included from the libs directory and the js directory, but in random order so you should wrap any javascript that
                requires functionality to be loaded in a document.ready OR rewrite the grunt file to join the files in the order you require</li>
                <li>Development html is included between the <code class="noblock">&lt;!-- @@DEVELOPMENT@@ --&gt;</code> comments and production
                html is included between the <code class="noblock">&lt;!-- @@PRODUCTION@@ --&gt;</code> comments.  This little hack is performed
                by the <a href="https://github.com/kriserickson/grunt-transform-html">transform_html</a> grunt task</li>
            </ol>

            As the Yeoman generator becomes more robust, more commands will be added but for now that is what you need to know.

        <h3>Editing ToDo's</h3>

        <div class="tutorialItem">
        Now let's get back to our application.  We are now on <a href="https://github.com/kriserickson/topcoat-touch-todo/tree/stage-3">stage-3</a> but when we
        are done editing we will be at <a href="https://github.com/kriserickson/topcoat-touch-todo/tree/stage-4">stage-4</a>.  
        </div>
        
        <div class="tutorialItem">

        The first thing we need to do is add an edit button.  Since eventually we are going to need to delete toDo's lets
        add that at the same time.  Place the following html in the index.html at the end of the #toDoView div.

<code class="language-markup">&lt;div class="topcoat-bottom-bar"&gt;
    &lt;div class="topcoat-bottom-bar-item full center"&gt;
        &lt;button class="topcoat-button--cta" id="editButton"&gt;Edit Todo&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;button class="topcoat-button--cta" id="deleteButton"&gt;Delete Todo&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code>
