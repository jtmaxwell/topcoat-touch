Topcoat Touch
=============

A very simple mobile framework based on the [Topcoat Framework](http://topcoat.io).  Inspired by
the [jQT](http://jqtjs.com/) framework.  Designed for very simple mobile apps with just a few
pages.  Uses [jQuery](http://jquery.com), [fastclick](https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick) and
[iScroll](https://github.com/cubiq/iscroll) to provide most of the functionality for a mobile
framework.

See index.html to see how it is used.
