Topcoat Touch
=============

A very simple mobile framework based on the [Topcoat Framework](http://topcoat.io).  Inspired by
the [jQT](http://jqtjs.com/) framework.  Designed for very simple mobile apps with just a few
pages.  Uses [jQuery](http://jquery.com), [fastclick](https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick) and
[iScroll](https://github.com/cubiq/iscroll) to provide most of the functionality for a mobile
framework.  Uses some of the CSS for page flipping from

See [index.html](/example/index.html) and [app.js](/example/js/app.js) to see how it is used.
