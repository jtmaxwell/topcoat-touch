Topcoat Touch
=============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kriserickson/topcoat-touch.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kriserickson/topcoat-touch)

A very simple mobile framework based on the [Topcoat Framework](http://topcoat.io).  Inspired by
the [jQT](http://jqtjs.com/) framework.  Designed for very simple mobile apps with just a few
pages.  Uses [jQuery](http://jquery.com), [fastclick](https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick), 
[iScroll](https://github.com/cubiq/iscroll), [hammer.js](http://eightmedia.github.io/hammer.js) to provide most of the functionality for a mobile
framework.  Uses some of the CSS for page flipping from the Christopher Coenraets [topcoat/backbone example](http://coenraets.org/blog/2013/06/sample-mobile-phonegap-application-with-backbone-js-and-topcoat)

See the example files [index.html](/example/index.html) and [app.js](/example/js/app.js) to see how it is used.
